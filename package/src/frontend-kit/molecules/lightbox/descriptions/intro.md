A lightbox is a Dialog window, appearing on top of the viewport, blocking and dimming its background.
It comes in 4 variants:

* The default lightbox has an image and a white bar with a close icon on top of it.
* The lightbox has a short caption below the image.
* The lightbox has a long caption below the image. This can be shown or hidden through toggling a button.
* The lightbox has more than one image and a white bar with controls (next image, previous image, current number of image shown) underneath it.

This component comes with a full API documentation at the end of this page.
