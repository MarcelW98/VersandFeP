- The navigation can be opened and closed by clicking the trigger menu icon on the top left.
- A click on a First Level Page menu item opens the corresponding page. Selecting a group opens or closes it, and closes a previous opened group.
- In the desktop viewport, when the side navigation is closed is seen as a narrow sidebar. When opened appears as a full-surface overlay panel.
