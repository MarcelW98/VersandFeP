A tile can be used to contain additional content such as text and images.

Tiles open a defined area of ​​an application, similar to anchor links.

In contrast to buttons, tiles do not trigger any function.

Tiles come with:

- three background variations: `primary`, `secondary` and `contrast`.
- five fill variations: `plain` (default), `purple`, `blue`, `turquoise`, `green` (all highlights).

<div
  class="a-notification -neutral"
  role="alert"
  aria-labelledby="how-to-use-tile"
>
  <i class="a-icon ui-ic-alert-info"></i>
  <div id="how-to-use-tile" class="a-notification__content">
    Please be aware that the shown spacings and sizes are only demonstrators and will not be part of the tile styles.
    For a usage of the tile to build an other component, e.g. a teaser, the spacing and sizes have to follow the BDDS.
