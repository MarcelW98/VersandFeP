Tab Navigations can have tabs that are all with Labels and Icons or with either Labels or Icons, but not mixed.
Individual tabs can be disabled.

If a tab is selected it would have the helper class `-selected`. Only one Tab can be selected at a time, and disabled tabs cannot be selected.

You can choose to use `<a>` or `<button>` tags as tabs; the former choice will have no additional functionality. When using `<button>`, see below for the callback API.
