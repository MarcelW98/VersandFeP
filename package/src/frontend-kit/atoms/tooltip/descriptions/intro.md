The tooltip can be used to show additional information in context. There are several variants to indicate the severity and importance of some tooltips like `error`, `warning`, `success` and the default one.

It is also possible to define the width of these tooltips. It can be either be either `dynamic` or `fixed`. Just have a look at the next examples and hover with your mouse over the text.

Please note that you need to define when and where a tooltip is visible â€“ see the examples at the end of this page for a no-JS solution for this. For a more involved example, take a look at the <a href="/atoms/slider/guide">Slider</a> component
