The layout component `e-container` is a useful CSS class to get a good first layout in terms of how to center content.
It provides a max-width for certain viewport and is keeping a small margin on tablet and mobile viewport.

If a full width container is needed, the modifier `-full-width` can be added, e.g to colorize the background.
That said, the content of the container, will still not grow over `1120px`.
